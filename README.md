### Issues 

There are a series of enhancements and/or technical cleanup required to move this from an MVP state to a polished/finished site that can be updated regularly by non-developers on the Turing Ops team. Github issues have been organized and labeled as follows (feel free to add/edit as necessary):

* __Design__: These are issues where aspects of the desired UI were not fully built out and/or areas of design related optimization needed.
* __Technical Debt__: Recognized areas of hurried janky code. :poop: happens.
* __Features/Enhancements__: Larger scale additions and/or integrations required for future maintainability.
